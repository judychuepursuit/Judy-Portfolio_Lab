Hello!- Welcome to my portfolio site.

This Portfolio Project site serves the following purposes:
Serves as a good example of the skills sets I have learned in the short time I have been a part of this amazing opportunity at Pursuit learning to code as a Fellow.

This Portfolio:
- Sketching/rendering the concept idea via Adobe CS Illustrator and marking the requirements as I went along was extremely helpful for me to stay organized and focused on the first section of requirements and also follow up with adding the "extra" rubric- 'technical innovation" portions
- Potential employers can see this as an example of my current capabilities after just 2 Modules as a Pursuit Fellow.

This project has:
- A deployed front-end application.
- Allow for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs.
- Make requests to an external API.
- Has a theme and unique proposeful design.

I hope you enjoy this portfolio pc as much as I did building it.
